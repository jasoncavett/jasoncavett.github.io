My name is Jason Cavett. I'm a software engineer with specific focus on user experience. I have had quite a bit of success in leading software engineering teams at various organizations.

I currently work as a consultant at Jacquette Consulting, Inc., however, this blog and its thoughts and opinions are entirely my own. Before I moved my blog, I primarily wrote about specific pieces of code I was working on, but I will be expanding to broader topics surrounding technology.

*Social Media*
You can find me on Twitter, Google+, and, of course, here at my blog. I am mildly active on StackOverflow. I also have a GitHub account, though it won't look like I ever commit anything because my "hack-around" repos are private. I dropped Facebook some time ago as I didn't find it very useful. I still have yet to pick up LinkedIn.

*Some History*
I am a graduate from [RIT's](http://www.rit.edu/) Galisano College of Computing and Information Sciences with a degree in Software Engineering and a focus in usability. While there, I was the co-founding president of RIT's Society of Software Engineers. I also learned to swing and blues dance.

I held a number of co-op positions including ones at: Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Goodrich Aerospace, and Lockheed Martin. I ultimately ended up at Lockheed where I joined their systems engineering group.

TODO - Add more details.

*More Details*
If you've scrolled this far, then you're braver than I thought!

I enjoy video games. I have far too many hours into all types of games with League of Legends being my latest favorite. I still swing and blues dance. I believe that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.

I have a wonderful family. I read voraciously.
