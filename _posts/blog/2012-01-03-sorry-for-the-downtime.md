For those of you who have hit my site looking for some answers (mostly folks coming from [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/)), I wanted to apologize for the short downtime. I was in the process of switching my registrar from GoDaddy to [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/) due to GoDaddy’s (original) stance on SOPA.

Things should be back up and running! I hope to have a few posts up soon. In the meantime, enjoy what’s already here.
